		Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble 
		was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong 
		of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. 
		Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, 
		and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the 
		find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted 
		dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by 
		which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.
